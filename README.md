## **Kirana shops classification**
####The project's task is to classify *kirana* shops images in 5 different business categories i.e. - 
1. Apparels
2. Pharmaceuticals
3. Electronics
4. Grocery
5. Food items

For classifying images, I implemented Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model built on Keras and Tensorflow. I performed **transfer learning** method on **[Places365](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/)** dataset
